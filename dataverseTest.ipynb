    "### Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Dataverse starter object `DATAVERSE_COLLECTION_START` in our configuration file we will create a new collection through the API https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.13/api/native-api.html#create-a-dataverse-collection. Luckily we do not need to follow the API documentation that instructs users to create a separate JSON file for use with the API endpoint. Since we added the JSON to our main configuration file we can simply reference the object in the `json` parameter of our request. We will place this collection under the root 'parent' collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving our collection info\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we already have our starter collection information defined in our main `_config_dataverseTest.json` file, there is no need to save the collection information sent back from the creation of our collection. We can always use the `ViewCollection()` method in our worker script to retrieve the collection information as long as we at least know our collection alias. \n",

    "### Issue\n",
    "\n",

If you want to know what the scripts do then review the .py files that we imported into this notebook. However we will briefly describe a line of code so you have a general idea of what is happening behind the scenes.\n",

    "The `objWorker.ObjDvApi.DvCreateCollection()` command for example, runs the `DvCreateCollection()` method, which is found in the `ObjDvApi` object, and makes a Dataverse API request to create a new repository/collection. The `ObjDvApi` is simply defined in an external Python file which contains reusable methods for working with the Dataverse API. We use this same class for all of our datasets, so keeping the methods in a single file for reuse is better than manually adding into the code of each of our datasets and making our working code script more densely worded than it needs to be.\n",

    "### The objWorker\n",
    "\n",
    "The `objWorker` is the object that we customize for each dataset and simply acts as a template for importing different classes/objects we want to attach to it. For instance, we attach the `ObjDvApi` to our `objWorker` object so whatever functionality exists in the `ObjDvApi` class can be used in our `objWorker` class. The `.` between `objWorker.ObjDvApi` simply represents that `ObjDvApi` is an extension of `objWorker`. An analogy would be adding a dustpan to a broom (or `broom.dustpan`) to extend the functionality of the broom, so the broom can now be used to pick up dust and not simply push it around.\n",
